# lazy-config
lazy config file-api written in c

# Philosophy

lazy-config is lazy both in usage and in reading, meaning it will be easy to use and will read on-the-go only what is necessary.

# Plan
- [ ] implement generic code that can parse most config files
- [ ] implement rudamentary ini support
- [ ] document it so well a 5y/o can use this
- [ ] maybe add windows support
- [ ] expand to other simple config formats

# goals
the goal of this library is to provide an easy to use api for using config files, not only should it automatically initialize config files but the users should also not have to worry about corrupted config files.
